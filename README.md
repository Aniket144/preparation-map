## Competitive Programming Roadmap

![CP Roadmap](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Aniket144/preparation-map/master/.github/images/Competitive%20Roadmap.png)

### 1. Learn a programming language
There are a lot of languages out there but strictly speaking from competitive perspective you should be comfortable with C++, Java or Python. Reasons being that these languages are very popular & there are lot of resources for you to learn, compare solutions and the platform you're going to give your test on should have definitive support for them. 


### 2. Object Oriented Principles
You should be comfortable with applying object oriented principles when designing a project. This empowers to create project that have good maintenance and easy to understand. 
   
### 3. Big-O Notation
Understand how to calculate the efficiency of a programming solution with respect to both time and space.

### 4. Basic Math 
A lot of complex programming problems can be reduced to simple problems if you treat it like a math problem to begin with.
