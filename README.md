## Competitive Programming Roadmap

![CP Roadmap](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Aniket144/preparation-map/master/Competitive%20Roadmap.png)

### 1. Learn a programming language
There are a lot of languages out there but strictly speaking from competitive perspective you should be comfortable with C++, Java or Python. Reasons being that these languages are very popular & there are lot of resources for you to learn, compare solutions and the platform you're going to give your test on should have definitive support for them. 


### 2. Object Oriented Principles
You should be comfortable with applying object oriented principles when designing a project. This empowers to create project that have good maintenance and easy to understand.

### 3. Big-O Notation
Understand how to calculate the efficiency of a programming solution with respect to both time and space.

### 4. Basic Math 
A lot of complex programming problems can be reduced to simple problems if you treat it like a math problem to begin with. 
- [Number Theory](https://brilliant.org/wiki/number-theory/)
- [Modular Arithmatics](https://brilliant.org/wiki/modular-arithmetic/)
- [Prime factorization](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/print-all-prime-factors-of-a-given-number/)
- [Prime Sieve](https://brilliant.org/wiki/sieve-of-eratosthenes)
 
### 5. Searching Algorithms
Searching Algorithms are desinged to retrieve data from a data structure where it is stored. 
- [Linear Search]()
- [Binary Search]()
- String/Pattern Search
    - Naive String Search
    - Rabin–Karp algorithm
    - Knuth–Morris–Pratt algorithm
    - Boyer–Moore string-search algorithm

### 6. Sorting Algorithms
Sorting Algorithms are desinged to rearrange a list of items/objects based on a comparison. You need to learn about different sorting algorithms and advantages/disadvantes of them. Don't be overwhelmed by the number of sorting algorithms out there, for most usecases you'll get by using the inbuilt sorting function available in the language utility library. 
- Selection, Bubble Sort
- Merge, Quick, Heap Sort

### 7. Basic Data Structures
Data structures have two purpose - Store and Retrieve values. Depending on your use case you should be able to understand which data structure would efficiently fit in with your algorithm or problem statement. 
#### Group 1: Array, LinkedLists, Queue, Stack 
#### Group 2: Heap, Map, Tree, Graph

### 8. Algorithm Techniques/Paradigms 
- Divide & Conquer
- Back Tracking
- Bit Manipulation
- Greedy Algorithms
- Dynamic Programming
- Graph Algorithms

### 9. Practice
- Codeforces
    - Contests every week. 
    - Quality questions with editorial available later. 
    - Best for testing out CP (Time constraint + Quality questions)
    - Not the type of questions that will come up in placement tests but these will prepare you for them.
- Codechef   
    - Monthly contests.
    - Long chalenges (10 days) useful for learning phase.
    - Can't see testcases. (There's debate whether it's good or bad)
- Hackerrank 
    - Best Interface IMO of all the available platforms.
    - Most of the companies will test on this platform only, so you should be comfortable with it.
    - Limited, unevenly distributed question bank.
    - Good for learning languages as there are different sections dedicated for that.
- GeeksForGeeks
    - Plethora of questions (CP, MCQs, Puzzles, etc) related to all type of topics. 
    - Ideal for placement preparation.
    - Okayish Interface for practice. 
    - Company specific resources => Interview experiences, Questions asked.
- InterviewBit
    - Placement Specific with good roadmap for preparation.
    - Simplistic design => Good for concentration if getting overwhelmed by GFG.
    - Limited questions but properly distributed into different domains.
    - Option to apply to other jobs.
